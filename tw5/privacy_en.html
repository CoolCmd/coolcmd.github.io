The extension was created by independent developer <bdi translate=no>Alexander Choporov (CoolCmd)</bdi>, who is not affiliated with <bdi translate=no>Twitch Interactive, Inc</bdi> company in any way.<h3>Data collection</h3><p>The data collection is not affected by the incognito mode of the <bdi translate=no>Google Chrome</bdi> browser and private browsing of the <bdi translate=no>Mozilla Firefox</bdi> browser. The extension does not work in <i translate=no>InPrivate</i> mode of the old <bdi translate=no>Microsoft Edge</bdi> browser.<p>The extension stores its settings on the user's computer. The user can change most of the settings in the player interface. Settings do not contain user personal data. Settings contain a random number that is used as a unique user identifier. The identifier is required to detect errors that occur only on a specific computer configuration.<p>During its work, the player collects logs, detailing all the work done by the player during the last few minutes. Logs do not contain user personal data. Logs contain only anonymous information (when possible). After closing the page with the player, the logs will be destroyed.<p>If an error occurred in the extension or a user wants to send feedback, the following data is sent to the Internet server rented by the extension developer:<ul><li>Arbitrary text and e-mail entered by the user (optional).<li>Extension settings (described above).<li>Player logs (described above).<li>If necessary, the last few seconds of the watched video.</ul><p>The user can view the contents of the data being sent and refuse to send it.<p>The Internet server collects the following data:<ul><li>The IP address of the computer that sent the data.<li>Request headers, such as <var translate=no>UserAgent</var> and <var translate=no>AcceptLanguage</var>.</ul><h3>Use of collected data</h3><p>The data sent by the user (described above) is stored on the computer of the extension developer and is used solely to improve the work of the extension. E-mail addresses are not used to send advertising and other information not related to the work of the extension. At the end of use, the collected data is destroyed.<p>The data collected by the Internet server (described above) is stored in the server logs and is used to improve the server performance.<h3>Sharing collected data with third parties</h3><p>The collected data is not shared with third parties.<h3>Use of other data</h3><p>During each start, the player reads the user authentication data that is stored (in cookies) on the <bdi translate=no>Twitch.tv</bdi> website. The player does not store this data in its settings. The player sends this data only to the <bdi translate=no>Twitch</bdi> server. This data is required to create a clip, earn <bdi translate=no>Channel Points</bdi>, follow the channel, etc.<h3>Data collection by third parties</h3><p>As described above, the player periodically sends user authentication data to the <bdi translate=no>Twitch</bdi> server. Also, the player inserts part of the <bdi translate=no>Twitch.tv</bdi> website — chat — on its page. Thus, the <bdi translate=no>Twitch Interactive, Inc</bdi> company can collect information about what channels the user watches, what messages they sends in the chat, etc. The <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-notice/ rel="noopener noreferrer" translate=no>Twitch Privacy Notice</a> describes how the company manages this information.<footer><p><small>Version of this document: 2020.03.16</small></footer></div>
